# Two Phase Simplex Method in MATLAB  
Implementation of Two Phase Simplex Method in MATLAB

This repository present code of two phase simplex method in Matlab. There are two main function 'simplex_eq' and 'simpex_ineq'.

# 'simplex_eq' function 
Can be called for equality constraints(=) problem.

# 'simplex_ineq' function 
Can be called for inequality constraints(<=,>=) problem.
